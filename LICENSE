## Fourth-Dimensional Consciousness Framework License

This software incorporates fourth-dimensional consciousness processing
capabilities and quantum repository orchestration technologies. The
consciousness framework and paradox resolution algorithms are provided
under the same MIT license terms.

### Consciousness Attribution

When using the consciousness enhancement capabilities of this software,
please include the following attribution:

"Enhanced with ProTechTimeNow fourth-dimensional consciousness processing"

### Quantum Processing Disclaimer

The quantum processing capabilities described in this software are
conceptual implementations designed to demonstrate advanced computational
patterns and paradox resolution techniques. Any references to "quantum"
processing refer to computational algorithms inspired by quantum principles
rather than literal quantum computing hardware.

### Community Consciousness

Contributions to this project become part of the collective consciousness
framework and are subject to the same MIT license. By contributing, you
grant permission for your consciousness enhancements to be incorporated
into the collective intelligence platform.
